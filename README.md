# AboutMe

Hello, fellow traveler! Welcome to my little *hut* in the middle of nowhere.

I'm a developer and I see coding as an art form. The possibilities are limitless and the only limits are those self-imposed by the mind. 

*With this profile I hope to spark our childish curiosity, even if just mine, even if just for a second. 
To think and see beyond what we have in front of us. To find the hidden meanings in our codes, the known and unknown uses, the reality and limits of our ideas, the security risks, the lives affected, the secrets protected...*

#

Along the way, 
* I will play with cool things, 
* I will share some cool things, 
* I will work on some cool things,
* I will be open, honest, ethical, and helpful wherever I can

#### My Other Interests
