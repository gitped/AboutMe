# About Me

Hello, fellow traveler! Welcome to my little *hut* in the middle of nowhere.

I'm just a guy who's into developing :) I see coding as an art form with limitless possibilities where the only limits are those self-imposed by the mind. 

With *this*, whatever *this* is, I hope to spark our childish curiosity, *even if just mine, even if just for a second.*
To think and see beyond what's in front of us. To discover the hidden meanings in our programming, the known and unknown potential, the reality and limits of our ideas, the security risks, the lives affected, the secrets protected...

Everyone has the power and the tools at their disposal to take over their world, but not everyone knows that.
And for those who do know that, not everyone tries.
And for those who do try, not everyone succeeds.
And for those who do succeed, success doesn't continue without going through a lot of failures.
And for those who fail, not everyone sticks around to learn from their mistakes. 
And for those who do learn from their mistakes, 
cudos to you! 
May you continue growing in experience and wisdom in facing the trials and tribulations of your long voyage.

*Our world evolves rapidly right under our feet and each person decides whether to sink or swim in this uproar of social and technological change.*

*I choose technology and code as my boat.*

Along the way, 
* I will play with cool things, 
* I will share some cool things, 
* I will work on some cool things,
* I will be open, honest, ethical, and helpful wherever I can
